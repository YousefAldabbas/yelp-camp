## My process

### Built with
#### frontend technology
- React
- Mui
- toastify
#### backend technology
- Node
- express
- mongoDB

### Continued development
- I'm going to rebuild the frontend with better technology( without MUi in this case ) because i ended up by restyling(rebuild) almost every component
- clean the code
